### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file for environment-specific configuration:

```env
# Application Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="VPS Desktop"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION="1.0.0"

# VNC Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_VNC_PORT=5901
NEXT_PUBLIC_VNC_TIMEOUT=30000

# File Storage
UPLOAD_DIR="./uploads"
MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600  # 100MB

# Security
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Default VNC Servers
The application comes with pre-configured VNC servers:
- Local VNC Server: `ws://localhost:5901`
- Remote VNC Server: `ws://192.168.1.100:5901`
- Cloud VNC: `wss://vnc.example.com:5901`

## Security Considerations

1. **VNC Connections**: Always use secure WebSocket connections (wss://) for remote VNC access
2. **File Uploads**: Validate file types and sizes to prevent malicious uploads
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for production deployment
4. **Firewall**: Configure firewall rules to restrict access to necessary ports only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **VNC Connection Failed**
   - Check VNC server URL format (must start with ws:// or wss://)
   - Ensure VNC server is running and accessible
   - Verify firewall settings

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check file size limits
   - Ensure upload directory has proper permissions
   - Verify file format restrictions

3. **Application Won't Start**
   - Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
   - Check for port conflicts (default: 3000)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
